title: "Day 1 — Project Kickoff + Health Ingestion"

## What was built
- Full project scaffold: `ingestion/`, `scheduler/`, `agent/`, `config/`, `data/`
- DuckDB schema: `health_metrics`, `stock_watchlist`, `reminders` (SCD2), `activities`
- `ingestion/health.py` — Garmin screenshot → DuckDB pipeline using llava:13b vision model
- `ingestion/schema.py` — `init_db()` to create all tables idempotently

## Key decisions
- **Local-only AI**: Ollama for all inference, no external API calls with personal data
- **Vision model for health data**: Garmin doesn't have an open API, so screenshots are the input — parsed by a vision LLM
- **DuckDB over SQLite/Postgres**: local file, zero infra, great DataFrame integration
- **Split model config**: `OLLAMA_VISION_MODEL` (llava:13b) vs `OLLAMA_SQL_MODEL` (qwen2.5-coder:32b) — different jobs, different models

## Problems faced
- **`INSERT OR REPLACE` is SQLite syntax** — DuckDB uses `ON CONFLICT (col) DO NOTHING`. Caught this early, fixed to standard SQL.
- **`schema.py` couldn't run directly** — relative import `from config.settings import DB_PATH` failed because Python adds the script's directory to `sys.path`, not the project root. Fixed with `sys.path.insert(0, ...)` at the top.
- **Initial health ingestion returned all nulls** — first test image was parsed but steps/HR/active_minutes all came back null. Model couldn't extract metrics from that particular screenshot. Known limitation of llava:13b.

## Concepts touched
- Vision LLMs for structured data extraction from images
- Local LLM inference with Ollama
- DuckDB upsert patterns
- Python package path resolution
