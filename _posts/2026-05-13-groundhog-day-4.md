title: "Day 4 — Stocks Ingestion + Agent Query Layer"

## What was built
- `ingestion/stocks.py` — yfinance-based stock price ingestion
- `config/watchlist.txt` — ticker + period config file (`INTC 7y`, `BTC-USD max`)
- `load_watchlist()` in `settings.py` — parses watchlist file into `(ticker, period)` tuples
- Historical backfill: 1,760 rows for INTC (2019–2026), 4,258 rows for BTC-USD (2014–2026)
- `agent/query.py` — text-to-SQL agent with interactive loop using `qwen2.5-coder:32b`

## Key decisions
- **yfinance** for stock data — free, no API key, good historical coverage
- **Per-ticker period in watchlist.txt** — avoids hardcoding periods in code, easy to extend
- **Two LLM calls in agent**: call 1 generates SQL, call 2 translates results to natural language answer
- **Schema injected into system prompt** — model knows table/column names at query time; enriched with actual ticker values and activity types so model doesn't hallucinate them. The schema string looks like this:

  ```
  stock_watchlist(date DATE, ticker VARCHAR, closing_price DECIMAL(10,2), ...)  -- tickers: INTC, BTC-USD
  activities(id VARCHAR, date DATE, activity_type VARCHAR, ...)  -- activity_types: walking, running, strength
  ```

  When you ask "what is bitcoin price?", the model sees `-- tickers: INTC, BTC-USD` next to the table and maps "bitcoin" → `BTC-USD` using general knowledge, but uses the exact string from the schema. This is pulled live from the DB at startup via `SELECT DISTINCT ticker FROM stock_watchlist` — so it stays in sync automatically as you add tickers.
- **`ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 1` rule** — told the model to use this for "latest price" queries instead of `CURRENT_DATE`, which fails when today's data hasn't been fetched yet

## Problems faced
- **Agent used wrong ticker symbol** — model generated `WHERE ticker = 'BTC'` instead of `'BTC-USD'`. Fixed by injecting actual ticker values from the DB into the schema context.
- **`CURRENT_DATE` returned no rows** — if today's price hasn't been fetched yet, the query returns empty. Added explicit instruction to use `ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 1` for latest price queries.
- **DuckDB rowcount returns -1** — `result.rowcount` after a bulk INSERT returns -1 in DuckDB, not the actual inserted count. Cosmetic issue only; data was inserted correctly.

## How the chat prompt works

When the agent receives a question, it builds a `sql_prompt` — a list of message dicts sent to Ollama's `/api/chat` endpoint:

```python
[
    {
        "role": "system",   # sets the model's persona and rules
        "content": "..."    # schema + constraints injected here
    },
    {
        "role": "user",     # the actual question
        "content": question
    }
]
```

The model processes them in order — system message first to establish context, then the user question. By the time it generates SQL it already knows the exact table structure, ticker names, and rules (like "use `ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 1` instead of `CURRENT_DATE`").

This is the standard chat format used by Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, and most LLM APIs — just a list of `{role, content}` dicts. The system role is the mechanism for injecting context without it being part of the conversation history.

## Concepts touched
- Text-to-SQL agents
- Schema-as-context prompt engineering
- Prompt rules to constrain SQL generation
- Two-step LLM pipelines (SQL generation → natural language answer)
