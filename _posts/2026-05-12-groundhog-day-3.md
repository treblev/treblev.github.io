title: "Day 3 — Model Upgrade to Qwen3-VL + max_hr"
date: 2026-05-12

## What was built
- Switched vision model from `llava:13b` to `qwen3-vl:latest` (6.1 GB)
- Successfully parsed multiple activities from a single screenshot
- Added `max_hr` field to prompt, schema (`ALTER TABLE`), and INSERT

## Key decisions
- **Qwen3-VL over llava**: Qwen3-VL has stronger instruction following and better structured output from UI screenshots. Confirmed by test — extracted 2 distinct activities (Strength + Running) with correct per-row metrics.
- **`ALTER TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`** for adding columns to a live DB without dropping and recreating
- **`ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET ... COALESCE`**: if a field was null on first insert and non-null on re-run, update it rather than skipping — useful when model extracts partial data across runs

## Problems faced
- **HTTP 404 on first Qwen3-VL call** — model name in `settings.py` was `qwen3-vl` but Ollama registered it as `qwen3-vl:latest`. Fixed by running `ollama list` to get the exact tag.
- **Kernel cache caused stale model name** — after updating `settings.py`, the notebook still used the old `OLLAMA_VISION_MODEL` value. Python module caching meant re-running the import cell wasn't enough. Fix: restart the kernel.
- **DuckDB lock error** — two processes tried to open the same DuckDB file simultaneously (notebook + terminal). DuckDB only allows one writer at a time.
- **`max_hr` was always null** — root cause: `max_hr` was added to the INSERT statement but not to the prompt. The model never knew to extract it. Fix: always keep prompt fields and INSERT fields in sync.
- **Hash collision on activity dedup** — when `duration_seconds` is null for multiple activities of the same type on the same day, all produce the same hash. `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` silently drops duplicates.
- **Non-breaking space in filenames** — macOS Finder saves screenshot filenames with `U+202F` (narrow no-break space) before `AM`/`PM`. Python's `Path` couldn't find the file when using a regular space. Fix: use `glob('*05-12*')` instead of hardcoding the filename.

## Concepts touched
- Vision model comparison (llava vs Qwen3-VL)
- DuckDB concurrency limitations
- macOS filename encoding gotchas
- Schema migrations on live DBs with ALTER TABLE
