title: "Day 2 — Multi-Activity Parsing (Failed Attempt)"

## What was attempted
- Updated `health.py` prompt to detect screenshot type: `daily_summary` vs `activity`
- Added `activities` table to schema with hash-based dedup `id`
- Built `notebooks/vision_prompt_evals.ipynb` as a playground to iterate on prompts without running the full pipeline
- Attempted to get llava:13b to extract multiple activities from a single screenshot

## Key decisions
- **Hash-based activity ID**: `SHA256(date | activity_type | duration_seconds)[:16]` — deterministic dedup without a sequence or UUID
- **Notebook for prompt evals**: separating prompt experimentation from ingestion code was the right call — much faster iteration loop

## Problems faced
- **llava:13b cannot reliably parse multiple activities** — when a screenshot showed 3 walking activities, the model returned the same values for all 3 (copied duration and HR across rows instead of reading per-row). Only 1 row ended up in the DB due to hash collision.
- **Prompt classification kept defaulting to `daily_summary`** — even with explicit instructions, llava would misclassify activity screens as daily summaries. Multiple prompt rewrites, all failed.
- **Model is not deterministic enough for structured extraction** — llava:13b is a general vision model, not tuned for precise table/list extraction from UI screenshots.

## What didn't work
- Prompt engineering alone could not fix llava:13b's limitations for this use case

## Lesson
llava:13b is too weak for structured multi-row extraction from Garmin screenshots. Need a better vision model.
